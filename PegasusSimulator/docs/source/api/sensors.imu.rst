Imu
===

The IMU is composed of a gyroscope and an accelerometer, which measure
the angular velocity and acceleration of the vehicle in the body frame, respectively. 
The bias/drift of the imu is given by a slowly varying random walk processes of 
diffusion, as described in :cite:p:`kalibr`, :cite:p:`maybeck`.
